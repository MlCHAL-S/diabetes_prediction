Diabetes Progression Regression Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict disease progression using various regression techniques. The key objective is to explore how different features, including age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and serum measurements, can be used to predict diabetes progression.

Features of the Project
* Dataset: Utilizes the less commonly used diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets.
* Preprocessing: Implements data scaling and transformation for better model fitting.
* Regression Algorithms: Evaluates Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor.
* Model Tuning: Employs GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of each model.
* Cross-Validation: Utilizes advanced techniques like KFold for model validation.
* Performance Metrics: Analyzes models based on computation time and prediction accuracy.
* Visualization: Includes plots for raw and preprocessed data, and model performance comparison.
